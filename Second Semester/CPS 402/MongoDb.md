MongoDB is a NO-SQL database, while NO means Not-Only SQL. It is document oriented which is an individual record. A collection is a group of MongoDb documents.

In NoSQL databases, **linking documents** like you would link tables in a relational database is **not always necessary**, and often **not recommended** depending on the use case. Here's a breakdown to help clarify:

---

### ðŸ”„ Relational Databases (SQL)

* **Normalized** structure.
* Data is stored in multiple tables.
* Relationships are enforced with **foreign keys**.
* Joins are used to combine data across tables.

### ðŸ“„ NoSQL Databases (e.g., MongoDB)

* Prefer **denormalization** â€” embedding related data inside a single document.
* Designed for **performance and scalability**, especially in distributed systems.
* Joins are **limited or costly**, though some NoSQL systems like MongoDB have `$lookup` for basic joins.

### âœ… When Linking Documents Is Necessary

Use **manual references** (like storing a documentâ€™s `_id` in another document) **if**:

* Data is **large and changes frequently** (e.g., user profile linked to comments).
* You want to **avoid duplication** and ensure data consistency.
* The relationship is **many-to-many** or **one-to-many**, and embedding would be inefficient.

Example:

```json
// Comment document
{
  "text": "Great post!",
  "userId": ObjectId("abc123"),
  "postId": ObjectId("xyz789")
}
```

### âœ… When Embedding Is Better

Embed data **inside** documents if:

* The relationship is **one-to-few** or **one-to-many (small)**.
* You want **fast reads** and can tolerate some duplication.
* The embedded data doesnâ€™t change often independently.

Example:

```json
// Blog post with embedded comments
{
  "title": "NoSQL Design",
  "comments": [
    { "user": "Alice", "text": "Nice post!" },
    { "user": "Bob", "text": "Helpful." }
  ]
}
```

### ðŸš€ Summary

You donâ€™t *have* to link documents in NoSQL the way you do in relational databases â€” **design your schema based on access patterns**, **read/write frequency**, and **scalability needs**. NoSQL favors **embedding over referencing**, unless thereâ€™s a strong reason to separate.
