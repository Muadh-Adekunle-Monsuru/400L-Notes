### **Detailed Comparison**  

#### **1. Database Manager**  
- **What They Do**:  
  - Manages the **database engine** (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB) to ensure efficient data operations.  
  - Implements **ACID properties** (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).  
  - Optimizes **query execution plans** and indexing.  
- **Technical Focus**:  
  - Works closely with developers to resolve performance bottlenecks.  
  - Monitors **memory usage, I/O operations, and CPU load**.  

#### **2. Database Administrator (DBA)**  
- **What They Do**:  
  - Designs **database schemas** and tables.  
  - Sets up **user permissions** (e.g., `GRANT SELECT ON table TO user`).  
  - Plans **disaster recovery** (backups, replication).  
- **Strategic Focus**:  
  - Ensures compliance with **data governance policies** (e.g., GDPR).  
  - Collaborates with IT teams on **hardware/cloud infrastructure**.
