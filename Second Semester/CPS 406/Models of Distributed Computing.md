### **Models of Distributed Computing**:

1. **Client-Server Model**
    
    - One machine (server) provides services; others (clients) request them.
        
    - _Example:_ Web servers and browsers.
        
2. **Peer-to-Peer Model**
    
    - All nodes are equal, acting as both clients and servers.
        
    - _Example:_ BitTorrent, blockchain systems.
        
3. **Three-Tier Model**
    
    - Divides system into: Presentation (UI), Application (logic), Database (storage).
        
    - _Example:_ Online banking apps.
        
4. **N-Tier Model (Multi-Tier)**
    
    - Extends the Three-Tier model with more specialized layers for scalability/flexibility.
        
    - _Example:_ E-commerce platforms like Amazon.
        
5. **Cluster Computing Model**
    
    - Linked computers work as a single powerful system.
        
    - _Example:_ Supercomputers for weather forecasting.
        
6. **Grid Computing Model**
    
    - Large-scale resource sharing across geographically distributed systems.
        
    - _Example:_ SETI@home.
        
7. **Cloud Computing Model**
    
    - Resources (e.g., servers, storage) provided on-demand over the internet.
        
    - _Example:_ Google Cloud, AWS.
