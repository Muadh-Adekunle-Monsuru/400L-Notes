## (a) Distributed Computing and Its Common Goals (5 Marks)

**Distributed computing** refers to a system where multiple computers work together over a network to achieve a common goal, appearing as a single coherent system to the end-user.

**Common goals of distributed computing:**
1. **Resource sharing** - Allows sharing of hardware, software, and data across networked computers
2. **Concurrency** - Enables multiple processes to run simultaneously on different machines
3. **Scalability** - Systems can be easily expanded by adding more nodes
4. **Fault tolerance** - The system continues functioning even if some components fail
5. **Transparency** - Hides the distributed nature of the system from users

## (b) Why Distributed Computing Over Client-Server (5 Marks)

Distributed computing is preferred over traditional client-server computing because:

1. **Better scalability** - Can handle growth more efficiently by adding more nodes
2. **Improved reliability** - No single point of failure (unlike client-server where server failure cripples system)
3. **Higher performance** - Workload can be distributed across multiple machines
4. **Geographical flexibility** - Components can be located in different physical locations
5. **Cost-effectiveness** - Can utilize existing hardware resources more efficiently
6. **Load balancing** - Work can be dynamically distributed to avoid overload

## (c) 5 Models of Distributed Computing (5 Marks)

1. **Client-Server Model** - Clients request services from servers which provide them
2. **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Model** - All nodes are equal and can act as both clients and servers
3. **Three-Tier Model** - Separates presentation (client), application logic, and data storage tiers
4. **N-Tier/Multi-Tier Model** - Further divides application into more specialized layers
5. **Cluster Computing** - Groups of similar computers work together as a single system
6. **Grid Computing** - Shares resources across different administrative domains

## (d) Mobile and Wireless Computing Applications (5 Marks)

**a. Fighting Insurgency:**
- Real-time communication between field operatives and command centers
- GPS tracking of personnel and equipment
- Mobile surveillance and reconnaissance using drones with wireless transmission

**b. Emergency Services:**
- Ambulances with mobile access to patient records en route
- Disaster response coordination using mobile devices
- Location-based emergency alerts to citizens' mobile devices

**c. Government:**
- Mobile platforms for citizen services (license renewals, tax payments)
- Wireless-enabled field inspections and reporting
- Emergency broadcast systems to mobile devices

## (f) Network Security Modeling Approaches (5 Marks)

Three approaches to modeling network security:

1. **Perimeter Security Model (Castle Approach)**
   - Focuses on strong outer defenses (firewalls, gateways)
   - Weakness: Vulnerable if perimeter is breached

2. **Layered Security Model (Defense in Depth)**
   - Multiple layers of security controls
   - If one layer fails, others provide protection
   - Includes physical, technical, and administrative controls

3. **Zero Trust Model**
   - "Never trust, always verify" principle
   - Strict identity verification for every access request
   - Micro-segmentation of network resources

**Best Approach:** The **Zero Trust Model** is currently considered the most effective as it addresses modern threats like insider attacks and compromised credentials, though it's more complex to implement. For most organizations, a combination of layered security moving toward zero trust principles is ideal.

This field addresses threats like malware, hacking, and data breaches through technologies like firewalls, encryption, and intrusion detection systems.

Effective security requires a layered approach combining technical solutions (antivirus software, encryption), physical protections (secure facilities), and administrative controls (security policies, training). As threats evolve, security measures must continuously adapt to address new vulnerabilities and attack vectors in our increasingly connected digital world.
