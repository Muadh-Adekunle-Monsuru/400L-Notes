1. _Differentiate between the following types of model and give an example each:_

**i. Discrete vs. Continuous Models**  

| **Discrete Model**                                                                    | **Continuous Model**                                                |     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| Represents systems where changes occur at specific, separate points in time or space. | Represents systems where changes occur smoothly over time or space. |     |
| Uses distinct, countable values (e.g., integers).                                     | Uses real numbers (infinite possible values).                       |     |
| **Example:** Queueing system (customers arrive at discrete times).                    | **Example:** Fluid flow in a pipe (pressure changes continuously).  |     |

**ii. Static vs. Dynamic Models**  

| **Static Model** | **Dynamic Model** |  
|------------------|-------------------|  
| Represents a system at a single point in time (no time dependency). | Represents a system over time (variables change with time). |  
| Used for equilibrium analysis or snapshots. | Used for studying evolution and transient behavior. |  
| **Example:** Economic supply-demand equilibrium model. | **Example:** Population growth model (tracking changes yearly). |  

**iii. Linear vs. Nonlinear Models**  

| **Linear Model** | **Nonlinear Model** |  
|------------------|--------------------|  
| Output is directly proportional to input (follows superposition principle). | Output changes disproportionately to input (complex interactions). |  
| Easier to analyze mathematically. | Often requires numerical methods for solutions. |  
| **Example:** Ohm’s Law (V = IR, voltage linear with current). | **Example:** Pendulum motion (due to sin(θ) in equations). |  

**iv. Deterministic vs. Stochastic Models**  

| **Deterministic Model**                                                | **Stochastic Model**                                                                 |     |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --- |
| No randomness—same inputs always produce the same outputs.             | Incorporates randomness (probabilistic elements).                                    |     |
| Used when system behavior is fully predictable.                        | Used for real-world uncertainty (e.g., failures, random arrivals).                   |     |
| **Example:** Projectile motion (physics equations with no randomness). | **Example:** Monte Carlo simulation (stock price prediction with random variations). |     |

#### 2. Explain the following terms as related to modeling and give an example each:
1. **System**  
   - A collection of interacting components (entities, processes, and resources) that work together to achieve a specific purpose.  
   - **Example**: A manufacturing plant (with machines, workers, and materials).  

2. **Event**  
   - A discrete occurrence that triggers a change in the system's state at a specific time.  
   - **Example**: In a traffic simulation, a "car arrival" or "traffic light change" is an event.  

3. **Entity**  
   - An individual object or component within the system that moves through processes and interacts with resources.  
   - **Example**: Customers in a bank queue, packets in a network, or products on an assembly line.  

4. **State**  
   - The current condition of the system at any given time, defined by the values of key variables.  
   - **Example**: In a hospital simulation, the state could include "number of occupied beds" or "queue length in ER."  

5. **Input**  
   - Data, parameters, or external factors fed into the model to define scenarios or initial conditions.  
   - **Example**: Arrival rates of customers, machine failure probabilities, or weather conditions in a crop model.  

6. **Output**  
	- Results generated by the simulation, used for analysis or decision-making.  
	- **Example:** Average wait time, system throughput, or resource utilization rates.

Assignment 2*

1. A biologist is employed by a fishery to help regulate the population of trout in a lake they own and control. The biologist estimates that the lake initially contains 150,000 trout, and that the trout population is growing at the rate of 15% per year. Currently, the fishery harvests trout at the rate of 30,000 fish per year.

(a) Set up and solve a difference equation for the fish population after n years
(b) How long does it take before the lake contains no trout?
(c) Suppose the fishery decides to change the harvesting policy so that the lake will still contain trout 20 years from now, what is the maximum harvesting rate that will allow this to occur?
(d) What is the maximum harvesting rate that can be allowed if the fishery wants the lake to always contain some trout?

2. A cache system has a hit rate of 90%. If the number of cache hits at time n (in hours) is given by H(n) = 0.9H(n-1) + 200, find the number of cache hits after 7 hours if H(0) = 800.
