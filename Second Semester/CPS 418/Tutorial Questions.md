## Difference Equations
1. Suppose that a savings account initially contains $80 and earns 5% interest. Determine a formula which describes how to compute each year's balance from the previous year's balance. Then solve the difference equation. Then find the amount at the 12th year
2. Solve the difference equation $Yn+1$ = $.2y+ 4.8$, $y_o = 1$.
3. Solve the difference equation $Y_{n+1} = -.8y + 9, y_o = 10$.
4. Suppose that the population of a certain country is currently 6 million. The growth of this population attributable to an excess of births over deaths is 2% per year. Further, the country is experiencing immigration to outside the country at the rate of 40,000 people per year. (a) Find a mathematical model for the population of the country. (b) What will be the population of the country after 35 years?
5. One thousand dollars is deposited into an account paying 5% interest compounded annually. At the end of each year $100 is added to the account. Let $y_n$ be the amount in the account after n years. Find a difference equation satisfied by $y_n$.
