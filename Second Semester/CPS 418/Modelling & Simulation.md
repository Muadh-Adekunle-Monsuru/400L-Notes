### **Unit 1: Basics of Modelling and Simulation**

#### **1. Introduction**
- Human decision-making is often clouded by uncertainty and imprecision.
- **Simulation** helps in evaluating and optimizing alternatives when direct testing is impractical or expensive.
- It's especially valuable for systems with complex interactions or delayed consequences.

#### **2. Intended Learning Outcomes**
After studying this unit, students should be able to:
- Define "model" and "modelling"
- Understand when and why models are used
- Describe the modelling process
- Identify different types of models

#### **3. Main Content**

##### **Definitions**
- **Modelling:** Creating abstract representations of systems to understand or predict behavior.
- **Model:** A representation (physical, conceptual, or mathematical) of a real-world entity or process.
- **Simulation:** Using a model to study the behavior of a system over time.
- **Computer model:** A model simulated on a computer with adjustable parameters.

##### **What is Modelling and Simulation?**
- It involves understanding systems and their interactions through iterative development and testing.
- It's both a science and an art‚Äîbest learned by practice.

##### **Types of Models**
1. **Physical Models:** Tangible representations (e.g., model airplanes).
2. **Mathematical Models:** Use equations to describe relationships.
3. **Analogue Models:** Use physical or electrical analogs (e.g., gauges).
4. **Simulation Models:** Use sequences of random numbers to emulate real systems.
5. **Heuristic Models:** Rule-of-thumb-based, often intuitive.
6. **Deterministic Models:** Fixed inputs, no randomness.
7. **Stochastic Models:** Include variables subject to probability.

##### **Advantages of Using Models**

Congrumental
INT(RND x N + 1 - P) + P

Generate a random number between 1-6
INT(RND x 6) +1



One way to get random digits is to simply start with an arbitrary number with a specified number of digits, for example 4 digits. The first number is called the seed. The seed is multiplied by a constant number of the same number of digits(length), and the desired number of digits is taken off the right end of the product. The result becomes the new seed. It is again multiplied by the original constant to generate a new product, and the process is repeated as often as desired. The result is a series of digits that appear randomly distributed as though generated by throwing a die or spinning a wheel. This type of algorithm is called a congruential generator.

## ‚úÖ **Unit 3: Congruential Random Number Generator**

---

### üß© **1. Introduction**

* Random number generation is essential in simulations.
* When no built-in RNG is available, developers must implement one manually.
* Classical RNGs have short periods and low uniformity.
* Modern congruential generators offer longer periods and better uniformity.

---

### üéØ **2. Intended Learning Outcomes**

By the end of this unit, you should be able to:

* Explain the Congruential Method of random number generation.
* Select suitable parameters (`a`, `c`, `m`) for implementation.
* Translate the methods into working code.
* Understand alternative methods: Mid-square, Mid-product, and Fibonacci.

---

### üìö **3. Main Content**

#### ‚úÖ 3.1 **Congruential Method**

* Based on **modulo arithmetic**:
  `Xn+1 = (aXn + c) mod m`

  * `X0`: Seed (initial value)
  * `a, c, m`: Carefully selected constants
* Types:

  * **Mixed Congruential Method**: `c ‚â† 0`
  * **Multiplicative Method**: `c = 0`

**Example:**
Using `a=5`, `c=7`, `m=8`, `X0=4`:

```
X1 = (5√ó4 + 7) mod 8 = 3
X2 = (5√ó3 + 7) mod 8 = 6
...
X8 = 4 ‚Üí cycle repeats
```

To scale to a desired range `[p, m]`:
`Xn+1 = ((aXn + c) mod (m + 1 - p)) + p`

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Example QBASIC Function:

```basic
FUNCTION RAND (SEED)
CONST M = 32767, A = 2743, C = 5923
IF SEED < 0 THEN SEED = SEED + M
SEED = (A * SEED + C) MOD M
RAND = SEED / M
END FUNCTION
```

#### üìå Example Program: Generate 20 integers between 1‚Äì64

```basic
DECLARE FUNCTION RAND(X)
DIM SHARED SEED
SEED = TIMER
FOR K% = 1 TO 20
  SEED = RAND(SEED)
  PRINT SEED
NEXT K%
FUNCTION RAND (SEED)
CONST M = 64, A = 27, C = 13
IF SEED < 0 THEN SEED = SEED + M
SEED = (A * SEED + C) MOD M + 1
RAND = SEED
END FUNCTION
```

---

#### ‚öôÔ∏è 3.2 **Choosing a, c, and m**

* Based on **Knuth‚Äôs Rules** for full period:

  * `a` and `c` must be carefully chosen.
  * For **m**:

    * If prime, `c` can be 0.
    * Conditions for full period:

      * `c` and `m` are relatively prime.
      * If `q` divides `m`, then `q` divides `a-1`.
      * If `4` divides `m`, then `4` divides `a-1`.

---

#### üé≤ 3.3 **RANECU Generator (FORTRAN)**

* Combines 3 multiplicative congruential generators.
* Suitable for 16-bit computers.
* Period > 8√ó10¬π¬≤
* Uses 3 seed values with constraints.

**Core Algorithm Logic:**

```fortran
ISEED1 = 157*(ISEED1 - K*206) - K*21
ISEED2 = 146*(ISEED2 - K*217) - K*45
ISEED3 = 142*(ISEED3 - K*222) - K*133
...
IZ = (ISEED1 - ISEED2 + ISEED3) mod 32362
```

#### üßÆ 3.4 **Other Random Number Generators**

| **Method**                 | **Formula**                   | **Comments**                   |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Quadratic Congruential** | `Xn+1 = (dX¬≤ + cX + a) mod m` | `m` should be a power of 2     |
| **Mid-square**             | `Xn+1 = middle_digits(Xn¬≤)`   | Tends to degenerate, slow      |
| **Mid-product**            | `Xn+1 = middle_digits(cXn)`   | Better than mid-square         |
| **Fibonacci**              | `Xn+1 = (Xn + Xn-1) mod m`    | Needs 2 seeds, poor randomness |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è These are mainly **of historical interest** and not suitable for modern simulation tasks.
