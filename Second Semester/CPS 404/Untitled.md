**Be Bold, Be Kind, Be You: Becoming the Best Version of Yourself**
*Presented by Muadh Monsuru*
Computer Science Student | Developer | Hackathon Winner

### **Slide 1: Introduction**

👋 **Hi everyone!**
My name is **Muadh Monsuru**, and I’m currently studying **Computer Science at Fountain University** here in Nigeria.
Like many of you, I’ve faced challenges — from choosing the right friends to staying focused in a world full of distractions.

Today, I want to share **how I’m becoming the best version of myself**—and how **you can too**.

---

### **Slide 2: Know Your Worth**

🌟 **You are valuable. You have potential.**
Growing up, I studied in both **Malaysia** and **Nigeria**. I faced culture shocks, tough classes, and the pressure to prove myself.
But I realized early on that **believing in yourself is step one.**

🏅 *When I won the Outstanding Cambridge Learner Award*, it wasn’t because I was the smartest — it was because I **believed I could**.

---

### **Slide 3: Set Big Goals, Then Chase Them**

🎯 At 17, I was already:

* Learning **JavaScript and Python**
* Building apps from scratch
* Competing in **hackathons** like the **QCall Hackathon** — and **winning**!

🏆 *Goal setting made that possible.*
Write down your goals. Big or small. Then act on them.

---

### **Slide 4: Beware of Peer Pressure & Scams**

⚠️ Growing up in Nigeria, I’ve seen **the wrong influences**:

* “Fast money” from internet fraud (Yahoo Yahoo)
* Peer pressure to “belong”
* The temptation to **drop your values for short-term gain**

But real success? **It takes time and effort.**
And when it comes, **it feels better** than anything gotten through shortcuts.

💡 *Being kind and disciplined is bold. It’s not weakness — it’s wisdom.*

---

### **Slide 5: University Life – Stay Focused**

🏫 University is exciting — but it’s also full of distractions:

* Friends who may not have your values
* Parties, pressure, and people watching you fail

📚 I stayed focused.
Even when it was hard.
And that’s how I:

* Became a finalist at the **Stutern Klusterthon Hackathon**
* Interned at real companies like **Byaxiom Solutions**
* Scored a **4.82 CGPA**

💡 Tip: Choose your friends **as carefully as your passwords.**

---

### **Slide 6: Give Back & Grow**

💖 I’ve volunteered:

* As a teacher at a **refugee school** in Malaysia
* Built websites for **nonprofits**

You don’t need to be rich to give back.
**Giving makes you grow.**
And kindness? It’s the boldest thing a young man can show in today’s world.

---

### **Slide 7: Final Words – Be Bold, Be Kind, Be You**

🔥 You have what it takes:

* To create apps
* To win awards
* To inspire others

But never forget:

* **Be bold**: Go after your dreams with courage
* **Be kind**: Treat others with respect
* **Be you**: Stay true to your values, no matter the pressure

---

### **Slide 8: Q\&A / Interactive Segment**

🤔 **Any questions?**
Or: “Tell me — what’s one goal you have for the next year?”
