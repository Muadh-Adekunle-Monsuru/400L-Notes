## **Definition of Network Security**

Network security is the process of protecting a computer network from internal and external threats. It ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of network resources by identifying potential risks and implementing measures to mitigate them.

---

## **Steps to Implement Network Security**

1. **Identify Assets**

   * Determine what needs protection: company files, data, routers, switches, etc.

2. **Identify Threats**

   * Understand what the assets are being protected from, such as unauthorized access or cyberattacks.

3. **Assess Risk Likelihood**

   * Evaluate how likely each threat is to occur.

4. **Implement Security Measures**

   * Apply cost-effective methods to protect assets.

5. **Continuous Review**

   * Regularly assess the process and improve security when issues arise.

---

## **Detailed Explanation of Each Step**

### 1. **Asset Identification**

Assets may include:

* Network equipment (routers, switches, firewalls)
* Network operational data (routing tables, cabling)
* Intangible resources (bandwidth, network speed)
* User privacy
* Information transmitted over the network

### 2. **Threat Assessment**

Categories of network attacks:

* **Unauthorized Access:** Gaining access to data or systems without permission.
* **Unauthorized Data Manipulation:** Altering or tampering with data maliciously.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** Preventing legitimate users from accessing network resources.
* **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):** Tools to monitor and detect unauthorized access attempts.

### 3. **Risk Assessment**

* Analyze the likelihood and potential impact of each threat.
* Risk categories:
  * Confidentiality
  * Integrity
  * Availability

**Example:** If a network resource is critical and the likelihood of attack is high, its risk level is **Fairly High**.

### 4. **Constructing a Network Security Policy**

A good policy should:

* Clearly state **what is protected** and **why**
* Identify **who is responsible**
* Provide guidelines for resolving **data conflicts**

It must also be **practical** and **enforceable** with current technologies.

---

## **Types of Network Security Policies**

* **Permissive Policy:** Anything not explicitly prohibited is allowed.
* **Restricted Policy:** Only explicitly allowed actions are permitted.

---

## **Key Policy Elements**

1. **Authentication Policy**

   * Enforces trust using password guidelines and remote login rules.

2. **IT and Maintenance Policy**

   * Outlines procedures for internal and external maintenance.

3. **Privacy and Monitoring Policy**

   * Sets expectations for privacy (e.g., email monitoring, keystroke logging).

4. **Availability Statement**

   * Defines expectations for resource uptime and recovery.

## 🔐 **CIA Triad in Network Security**

The **CIA Triad** is a foundational model in information security, representing the three key principles necessary to secure data and systems:

---

### 1. **Confidentiality**

* Ensures that information is accessible only to those authorized to have access.
* Involves protecting personal privacy and proprietary data.
* **Loss of confidentiality** occurs when there is **unauthorized disclosure** of information.

---

### 2. **Integrity**

* Protects information from being modified or destroyed in an unauthorized manner.
* Includes guarantees of **authenticity** and **non-repudiation**.
* **Loss of integrity** happens when there is **unauthorized alteration** of data.

---

### 3. **Availability**

* Ensures that authorized users have **reliable and timely access** to information and resources when needed.
* Threats to availability include **system failures**, **Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks**, and **natural disasters**.
* Loss of availability is the distruption of access to or use of information 
* 
---

## 🔏 **Non-Repudiation**

* A **security measure** that ensures individuals cannot deny their actions or participation in a transaction.
* Prevents parties from denying:
  * Sending a message
  * Signing a contract
  * Performing a specific action

---
## **Additional Security Concepts**

In some areas of cybersecurity, additional concepts are necessary to present a complete picture of a secure system. Two of the most commonly referenced are:

* **Authenticity**
  Refers to the **genuineness** of data or communication. It ensures that data, messages, or users are verifiable and trustworthy.

* **Accountability**
  Since achieving perfectly secure systems is not currently possible, it is crucial that systems can **trace security breaches** to responsible parties. This requires systems to maintain detailed logs of all activities to enable **forensic analysis**.

---

## **Implementing a Network Security Policy**

Once a security policy has been created, the following steps are essential for its successful implementation:

1. **Stakeholder Agreement**
   Ensure that all parties—management, technical staff, and end users—**understand and agree** with the security policy.

2. **User Education**
   Educate all affected individuals, including management, on the **importance of security** and their role in maintaining it.

3. **Cost Considerations**
   Recognize that **security implementation is costly** and often requires ongoing investment.

4. **Cost and Risk Communication**
   It is essential to communicate the **cost-benefit and risk analysis** involved in developing the policy to management and financial stakeholders.

5. **Defined Responsibilities**
   Clearly assign **roles and responsibilities** for different parts of the network infrastructure, including reporting structures.

---

## **Core Elements of Network Design**

A well-structured network security architecture typically includes:

1. **Firewall**
   Acts as a barrier between trusted and untrusted networks, controlling incoming and outgoing traffic.

2. **Remote Access VPN**
   Enables secure communication for remote users by encrypting the connection.

3. **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**
   Monitors network traffic for suspicious activities and potential threats.

4. **Security AAA Server**
   Provides **Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting** services to manage user access.

5. **SSH (Secure Shell)**
   A cryptographic protocol for **secure remote administration** and data transfer.

6. **Access Control & Access Limiting**
   Ensures that users only have access to the resources and data necessary for their roles.

## **Database Security**

Database security encompasses a variety of measures aimed at safeguarding a Database Management System (DBMS) from cyber threats, data breaches, and unauthorized access. It ensures the **integrity**, **availability**, and **confidentiality** of data.

---

## **Network Security Overview**

### **Basic Principles (as covered in lectures):**

* **Authentication and Authorization**: Verifies user identity and assigns appropriate access levels.
* **Encryption**: Secures data both in transit and at rest using techniques such as **MD5** and **SHA1**.
* **Access Control**: Implements controls like **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** and **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)** to restrict user actions based on permissions.
* **Backup and Recovery**: Ensures data availability and continuity in case of failure or loss.
* **SQL Injection Prevention**: Utilizes **parameterized queries** to protect against injection attacks.

---

## **Security Control and Auditing**

Security controls are protective measures put in place to **prevent**, **detect**, or **respond** to security risks.

### **Types of Security Controls:**

* **Administrative Controls**: Includes policies, procedures, and end-user training (e.g., **Security Awareness Training**).
* **Technical Controls**: Involves software and hardware mechanisms such as **firewalls**, **antivirus**, and **IDS**.
* **Physical Controls**: Includes tangible barriers like **biometric locks**, **security cameras**, and **access cards**.

### **Categories of Security Controls:**

* **Preventive**: Block attacks before they occur (e.g., firewalls).
* **Detective**: Identify and alert administrators of incidents (e.g., Intrusion Detection Systems).
* **Corrective**: Restore systems after a breach (e.g., backup recovery tools).
* **Deterrent**: Discourage attacks through visible security (e.g., CCTV).
* **Compensatory**: Alternative controls used when primary ones aren’t feasible.

---

### **Security Auditing**

Security auditing involves the systematic evaluation of security practices and controls to ensure compliance and identify vulnerabilities.

#### **Key Activities:**

* **Log Review**: Regular inspection of system and access logs.
* **Vulnerability Assessment**: Scanning systems for known security weaknesses.
* **Penetration Testing**: Simulating cyberattacks to evaluate defense mechanisms.
* **Compliance Checks**: Verifying adherence to regulatory standards and policies.
