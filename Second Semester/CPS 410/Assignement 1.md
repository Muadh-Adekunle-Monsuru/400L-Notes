### **1a. List and explain the solving queuing network models**

There are several methods for solving queuing network models. These include:

#### **i. Analytical Solutions**

Used for simple queuing models (e.g., M/M/1, M/M/c).

* Closed-form mathematical formulas are used to calculate key performance measures like average number of jobs (L), average waiting time (W), and server utilization (ρ).

#### **ii. Jackson Network**

Used for **open queuing networks** with exponential service times and Poisson arrivals.

* The system can be broken down into independent M/M/1 queues and analyzed separately.
* Useful for modeling web servers, transaction systems, etc.

#### **iii. Mean Value Analysis (MVA)**

Used for **closed queuing networks** where the number of jobs is fixed.

* An iterative method that estimates:

  * Throughput (X)
  * Response time (R)
  * Average queue length (L)

#### **iv. Simulation**

Used when analytical models are too complex.

* Software tools (e.g., SimPy, GPSS) simulate the queuing process over time to observe system performance.
* Suitable for real-world systems with complex interactions.

### **1b. The formulas involved in analytical solutions; explain the meaning of the expressions and what they stand for**

For a basic **M/M/1** queue:

#### **1. Utilization (ρ):**

$$
\rho = \frac{\lambda}{\mu}
$$

* **λ** = Arrival rate (average number of jobs arriving per unit time)
* **μ** = Service rate (average number of jobs the server can handle per unit time)
* **ρ** indicates how busy the server is (must be < 1 for the system to be stable).

---

#### **2. Average number of jobs in the system (L):**

$$
L = \frac{\lambda}{\mu - \lambda}
$$

* **L** is the average number of jobs in the system (both waiting and being served).

---

#### **3. Average time a job spends in the system (W):**

$$
W = \frac{1}{\mu - \lambda}
$$

* **W** is the average total time a job spends in the system (waiting + service time).

---

#### **4. Little’s Law (for validation):**

$$
L = \lambda \cdot W
$$

* This fundamental relation ties together arrival rate, average system time, and average number of jobs.

### **1c. Where are the formulas applicable?**

The above formulas are **applicable only when:**

* The system follows **Poisson arrivals** (memoryless inter-arrival times).
* The **service time** is **exponentially distributed**.
* The system being modeled is **stable** (i.e., λ < μ).
* Typically used in:

  * Web servers
  * CPU scheduling
  * Print servers
  * Call centers
  * Any single-queue, single-server setup

### **1d. What is the advantage or benefit of queuing theory models?**

1. **Predict Performance**: Allows estimation of system metrics (delay, utilization) before implementation.
2. **Identify Bottlenecks**: Helps locate which components of a system are overloaded or inefficient.
3. **Optimize Resources**: Supports decisions on how many servers or resources are needed.
4. **Cost-effective**: Reduces the need for expensive real-world experiments.
5. **Scalability Analysis**: Evaluates how performance changes with workload increase.
6. **Supports System Design**: Especially useful during the design phase of client-server systems, networks, and databases.
